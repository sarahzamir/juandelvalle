# What is this site for?
{: .no_toc }

This website is designed specifically for HIST295LA: Workshop on Historical and Digital methods in Latin-American History, taught by Professor Juan Cobo.
In this website, readers can expect to find a roadmap for my prospectus for my master's thesis at UCSB, which will focus on aspects of Spanish Colonial legal history, primarily the relationship between the Sacraments of the Catholic Church and restitution payments, in the sixteenth century in Popayán, Nuevo Reino de Granada.
