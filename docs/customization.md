#### Protector of the Indians

The Protector of Indians (_Protectoría de los Indios_ in Spanish) was an administrative office of the Spanish colonies, that was responsible for ensuring the well being of the native populations in the Americas, including defending individuals or groups in a court of law and reporting back to the King of Spain. Because of the significant geographic distance between the Spanish Colonies and mainland Spain, this communication was limited to written correspondence. The title was introduced under the reign of King Charles V. The notable Dominican friar, and later Bishop of Chiapas, Bartolomé de las Casas, was the first to hold the title. Juan del Valle held this tile when appointed as Bishop of the Diocese of Popayán by Pope Paul III in 1547.

## Influential Thinkers

### Aristotle (384–322 B.C.)

>Aristotle was an Ancient Greek philosopher and scientist who is still considered one of the greatest thinkers in politics, psychology and ethics. Aristotle wrote several influential works which touched on themes of reasoning, rhetoric, politics, ethics, science and psychology.



### Thomas Aquinas (1225- 7 March 1274)

>Aquinas proposed in his writings that faith and reason, and science and theology, were not mutually exclusive and could co-exist. The aim of his works was to prove that the balance of logic and the natural sciences, along with the philosophical concerns of Christian doctrine could reach a middle ground.

The works of both Aristotle and Aquinas held influence in discussions between intellectuals, Church authority, and civil authority regarding the proper treatment of Indigenous populations in the New World.
