## What is the _encomienda_?

In the early 16th century, the Spanish crown set up the encomienda system in the Americas to divide up the American Indian labor force in order to aid the development of their mining economy. Under this system a Spanish conquistador, or another prominent male Spaniard (known as an _encomendero_), was granted the labor of a certain number of the Indigenous populations living in the area. The _encomendero_ provided oversight and security over Indigenous peoples whom were considered under their protection from warring tribes, and teachings in the Catholic faith. The native laborer paid tributes to the _encomendero_ in the form of gold or other metals, or agricultural products.

The system was designed to include the Crown's newly conquered dominions, as vassals of the King. However, the lack of royal authority on the ground combined with geographic distance from mainland Spain saw the system quickly devolve into a lawless arrangement. Many indigenous peoples were treated poorly and often forced into hard labor.

The crown attempted to fix the system by passing various laws throughout the century, but strong objections from various groups of town _cabildos_ ended up with _encomenderos_ refusal to comply with these new measures. Eventually, the _encomienda_ system was replaced by the _repartimiento_ system, but it was not abolished until the late 18th century.
